The ``5-text_indentation`` module
======================

Using ``text_indentation``
-------------------

This is a Function Test in reStructuredText format.  First import
``text_indentation`` from the ``5-text_indentation`` module:

    >>> text_indentation = __import__('5-text_indentation').text_indentation

Now test it:
Test1 : text is string with "." , "?" and ":" delimeters

    >>> text_indentation("test drive : is boring. is that true? i think test is so important")
    test drive :
    <BLANKLINE>
    is boring.
    <BLANKLINE>
    is that true?
    <BLANKLINE>
    i think test is so important

Test2 : text is string without delimeters

    >>> text_indentation("i think test is so important")
    i think test is so important

Test3 : text is string with whitespace at beginning and the end

    >>> text_indentation(" test drive : is boring. is that true? i think test is so important ")
    test drive :
    <BLANKLINE>
    is boring.
    <BLANKLINE>
    is that true?
    <BLANKLINE>
    i think test is so important

Test4 : text is not string

    >>> text_indentation(3421)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    TypeError: text must be a string
